                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> I developed a model to help with budgeting and resource allocation by forecasting the monthly number of customers enrolling in specific programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> The model provided a reliable way to predict monthly enrollments, enabling the organization to plan budgets, allocate resources more effectively, and optimize programs. 
                        By accounting for seasonality and external factors, it significantly improved the accuracy of quarterly forecasts and supported smarter decision-making.</li>

                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> The analysis helped the organization gain a deeper understanding of its low-income customer base and address critical business questions, such as identifying factors affecting participation rates, 
                        evaluating the effectiveness of existing communication strategies, uncovering barriers to program engagement, and determining correlations between demographic or behavioral patterns and program participation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> I performed an exploratory analysis on a dataset of over 50,000 customers, using pivot tables, scatter plots, histograms, and data grouping to identify patterns, trends, and feature relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> I utilized Python and SQL for data cleaning and preprocessing, with analysis and visualizations created in Tableau.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Cleaning and merging data from multiple sources was a key challenge, which I effectively addressed using Python pandas library.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results:</strong> The analysis revealed various factors, such as age, that affected participation rates. 
                        It also raised new questions about whether current outreach methods were effective, forming the basis for a survey conducted among customers to explore similar questions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This initiative ensured early recognition of low-income customers, enabling better financial aid distribution, reducing payment delinquencies, and optimizing the utilization of government-supported program budgets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> I researched publicly available datasets from sources like the Census and OpenDataPhilly. Using these sources, 
                        I identified low-income housing locations in the city and integrated this data with our dataset to pinpoint potential customers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> I preprocessed the data using Python to standardize and align it with the companyâ€™s formatting before merging it with our customer data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> The main challenge was identifying publicly available datasets that addressed key organizational issues while ensuring data quality. 
                        I tackled this by prioritizing the organization's challenges, researching datasets relevant to the top problems, and focusing on government-provided or well-documented data to maintain quality standards.</li>

                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The purpose of this project was to identify disparities in energy usage and energy burden between customer programs, forecast future burdens, and provide actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This tool provided a deeper understanding of customer energy usage, helping the organization reduce operational inefficiencies, enhance program performance, and better support customers with high energy burdens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong>  I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize energy usage trends across customer programs. The dashboard provided detailed comparisons based on housing attributes like construction year and living area. 
                        Additionally, I incorporated a feature to estimate energy burden using historical averages, total customer counts, and customizable group definitions for tailored analysis.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> The biggest challenge was creating an interactive Tableau dashboard that directly addressed business needs while allowing users the flexibility to explore the data further. I overcame this by studying effective dashboard designs, 
                        collaborating closely with senior team members to understand stakeholder priorities, and organizing the dashboard into clear, functional sections. Using SQL and Tableau, I incorporated essential features and ensured the tool was intuitive and impactful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results:</strong>  I created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that offered insights into energy usage patterns, facilitated comparisons between customer programs, and provided forecasting capabilities for energy burden, significantly improving program analysis and decision-making.

                        To further explore this and address broader questions surrounding low participation rates, I conducted a survey to assess program awareness, effectiveness, and the impact of various factors on engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> The survey provided critical insights into customer perceptions of financial assistance programs, the effectiveness of existing outreach campaigns, and areas for improvement. 
                        By addressing key business questions, it enabled the organization to refine awareness efforts, enhance program engagement, and optimize communication strategies to better meet customer needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong>   I spearheaded the survey with the help of Bellomy Research among 900 customers. The survey posed questions related to program awareness, preferred communication methods, customer satisfaction, and other relevant topics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> I merged the survey responses with customer data using Excel and derived analytical insights using Tableau and Python.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Formatting the survey responses for analysis was a significant hurdle, particularly because much of the data was textual.

                    The model is designed to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews, leveraging one-hot encoding for vectorization to capture contextual dependencies in text data. 
                    A sequential neural network with multiple LSTM layers and a dense output layer using a sigmoid activation function was implemented for classification. 
                    The project examines the network architecture and its performance, highlighting the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in sentiment analysis.

                  <p class="projects__row-content-desc">
                    This project aimed to provide industry analytics based on a user's LinkedIn profile, offering insights into salary trends, job openings, and industry shifts pre- and post-COVID. 
                    A dashboard built with Plotly Dash integrated the LinkedIn API to fetch user data and analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics datasets. 
                    Vectorization techniques and cosine similarity were used to identify similar industries, enhanced by Hugging Faceâ€™s BERT model for improved embeddings. GeoPandas helped in visualising geographic trends for those industries. 
                    The result? A data-driven, interactive tool that delivers personalized insights into industry projections, leveraging data science techniques and public datasets to inform career decisions.
