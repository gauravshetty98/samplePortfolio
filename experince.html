                <h3>Monthly Customer Enrollment Forecasting Using Time-Series Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    To budget for the discounts given to certain programs, the organization wanted a model which could forecast the monthly customer enrolled in the program.
                    Due to seasonality in historic trends, used the time-series model Prophet achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 10%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final results were published in an Excel dashboard which contained interactive elements to view how the forecast changed based on policy changes.
                    The model was well received by the team for its accuracy, accessibility, and ability to incorporate external factors into projections.
                    These projections were reviewed during monthly meetings to evaluate and optimize budget allocation for discount programs.

                <h3>Analysis of Low-Income Customer Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    The company's low-income program provided benefits like relief funds and financial assistance, but many eligible customers didn't use them.
                    I analyzed low-income customer behavior to identify patterns and reasons for low participation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analysis done over 100k customers revealed various patterns, one of them being how more than 50% of our younger customers were not applying to the main relief fund.
                    It also uncovered how one relief fund was being used more because of a better communication strategy which helped in spreading awareness among younger customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analysis led to a revamped communication strategy to include targeted outreach for younger customers. Additionally, text messages and emails were introduced to better engage this demographic.
